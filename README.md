# SecusmartCodeTestAndroid
Code test for solving the three circle problem using a c++ algorithm and an android implementation.

PART 1
======

The three circles are aligned and we compute the two other tangents to those circle, which are symmetric as a mirror

The code has been implemented using an android application for drawing the circles as well as C++ code linked to this application to solve and compute the centers and radiuses of these circles we wanted to know abut.
